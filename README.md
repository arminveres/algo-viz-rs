# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer and Auralizer

The algorithms were adopted from [TheAlgorithms/Rust](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust)

## Dependencies

- Rust Compiler
- All rust dependendencies will be automatically downloaded and compiled

**ATTENTION: ggez, the graphics library, requires the developmental version `0.9.0-rc0`, which works for newer compilers.
For the rust toolchain below `1.67` version `0.8.1` works.**

## TODO

- [x] Rectangle visualization
- [ ] Step to step sorting update in GGEZ
  - [x] Bubble Sort
  - [x] Insertion Sort
  - [ ] Third Sort option, maybe heap or merge sort
- [ ] Auralization for sorting: we can use [cpal](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal.git)
- [ ] Add tests for sortings algos
